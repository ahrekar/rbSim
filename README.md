# rbSim
A short simulation program written in python to model 
electrons passing through rubidium. The python code
makes use of existing packages such as numpy. Make 
sure that you have this package installed. If you're
not sure what all this means, I recommend installing
anaconda, which should contain all of the packages 
needed for this code.
